0.3.7
===
- Making pystruct compatible with Python3 (3.5 actually)
- Making CI happy (but unstable??)

0.3.6
===
- Taking into account Andreas feedback on the PR

0.3.5
===
- Few fixes
- all tests are passing

0.3.4
===
- MIT license
- all tests are passing except test_latent_node_crf_learning.py (as in 0.2.4)


0.3.3
===
- ad3 now supports the NodeTypeEdgeFeatureGraphCRF model
- ad3+ required only for hard logic constraints
- smaller memory footprint than 0.3

0.3
===
- Added new model NodeTypeEdgeFeatureGraphCRF
- Added inference method ad3+ for new model and for supporting hard logic constraints in other CRF models

0.3
===
- Removed libdai bindings that were very experimental.

0.2.3
=====
- Added max-prod inference, including loopy bp, tree bp and a special case for chains.

0.2
===
- Added BCFW.
- Added averaging in stochastic gradient descent.
- Added "snakes" dataset.
- Much faster interface to OpenGM.
- Speed improvements in loss-augmented inference.
- Renamed psi to joint_feature, as the joint feature function is sometimes also called phi, with psi referring to the energy.
- Removed the GLPK dependency: now cvxopt is used to solve linear programs.
