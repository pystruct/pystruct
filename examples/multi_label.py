=========================
Mult-label classification
=========================
This example shows how to use structured support vector machines
(or structured prediction in general) to do multi-label classification.

This method hab been investigated in
Finley, Joachims 2008
"Training Structural SVMs when Exact Inference is Intractable"

And is an interesting test-bed for non-trivial structured prediction.
We compare independent predictions, full interactions and tree-structured
interactions with respect to run-time and accuracy.
By default, the "scene" dataset is used, but it is also possible to use the
"yeast" datasets, both of which are used in the literature.

To compute the Chow-Liu tree for the tree structured model, you need
to install either a recent scipy or scikit-learn version.
