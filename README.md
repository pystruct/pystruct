PyStruct
========

PyStruct aims at being an easy-to-use structured learning and prediction library.
Currently it implements only max-margin methods and a perceptron, but other algorithms
might follow.

The goal of PyStruct is to provide a well-documented tool for researchers as well as non-experts
to make use of structured prediction algorithms.
The design tries to stay as close as possible to the interface and conventions
of [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org).

Currently the project is mostly maintained by Andreas Mueller, but contributions are very welcome.
I plan a stable release soon.

The full documentation and installation instructions can be found at the website:
