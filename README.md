PyStruct
========

PyStruct aims at being an easy-to-use structured learning and prediction library.
Currently it implements only max-margin methods and a perceptron, but other algorithms
might follow.

The goal of PyStruct is to provide a well-documented tool for researchers as well as non-experts
to make use of structured prediction algorithms.
The design tries to stay as close as possible to the interface and conventions
of [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org).

You can install pystruct using

> pip install pystruct

Some of the functionality (namely OneSlackSSVM and NSlackSSVM) requires that cvxopt is installed.
See the [installation instructions](http://pystruct.github.io/intro.html) for more details.

The full documentation and installation instructions can be found at the website:
http://pystruct.github.io

You can contact the authors either via the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pystruct)
or on [github](https://github.com/pystruct/pystruct).

Currently the project is mostly maintained by Andreas Mueller, but contributions are very welcome.

Jean-Luc Meunier (Naver Labs Europe) contributed a new model and did some maintenance, in the course of the EU READ project. See [READ_Contribution.md](https://github.com/pystruct/pystruct/blob/master/READ_Contribution.md)
