What is structured learning?
============================

Structured prediction is a generalization of the standard paradigms of
supervised learning, classification and regression. All of these can be thought
of finding a function that minimizes some loss over a training set. The
differences are in the kind of functions that are used and the losses.

In classification, the target domain are discrete class labels, and the loss
is usually the 0-1 loss, i.e. counting the misclassifications. In regression,
the target domain is the real numbers, and the loss is usually mean squared
error.
In structured prediction, both the target domain and the loss are
more or less arbitrary. This means the goal is not to predict a label or a
number, but a possibly much more complicated object like a sequence or a
graph.

What does that mean?
--------------------

In structured prediction, we often deal with finite, but large output spaces Y.
This situation could be dealt with using classification with a very large
number of classes. The idea behind structured prediction is that we can do
better than this, by making use of the structure of the output space.

A (very simplified) example
---------------------------

Let's say we want to generate text from spoken sentences. Viewed as a pure
classification problem, we could see each possible sentence as a class. This
has several drawbacks: we have many classes, and to do correct predictions, we
have to have all possible sentences in the training set. That doesn't work
well. Also, we might not care about getting the sentence completely right.

If we misinterpret a single word, this might be not as bad as
misinterpreting every word. So a 0-1 loss on sentences seems inappropriate.
We could also try to view every word as a separate class and try to predict
each word individually. This seems somehow better, since we could learn to get
most of the word in a sentence right. On the other hand, we lose all context.
So for example the expression "car door" is way more likely than "car boar",
while predicted individually these could be easily confused.
For a similar example, see :ref:`plot_letters.py`.

Structured prediction tries to overcome these problems by considering the
output (here the sentence) as a whole and using a loss function that is
appropriate for this domain.

A formalism
-----------
I hope I have convinced you that structured prediction is a useful thing. So
how are we going to formalize this? Having functions that produce arbitrary
objects seem a bit hard to handle. There is one very basic formula at the heart
of structured prediction:

.. math::

    y^* = \arg \max_{y \in Y} f(x, y)

Here x is the input, Y is the set of all possible outputs and f is a
compatibility function that says how well y fits the input x. The prediction
for x is y*, the element of Y that maximizes the compatibility.

This very simple formula allows us to predict arbitrarily complex outputs, as
long as we can say how compatible a given output is with the input.

This approach opens up two questions:

How do we specify f? How do we compute y*?

As I said above, the output set Y is usually a finite but very large set (all
graphs, all sentences in the English language, all images of a given
resolution). Finding the argmax in the above equation by exhaustive search is
therefore out of the question. So we need to restrict ourselves to f such that
we can do the maximization over y efficiently. The most popular tool for
building such f is using energy functions or conditional random fields (CRFs)
[which are basically the same for finding y*].

There are basically three challenges in doing structured learning and prediction:

* Choosing a parametric form of f
* solving :math:`\arg\max_y f(x, y)`
* learning parameters for f to minimize a loss.

PyStruct takes :math:`f` to be a linear function of some parameters and a feature function :math:`Psi`.
Then the parametric form is given by the :ref:`models`.
The second problem, computation of the argmax, is done via third party inference solvers.
The interfaces to these are explained at :ref:`inference`.
The last part, the learning is actually the core part of PyStruct.
There are several different algorithms implemented, which you can find under :ref:`learning`.

There have been many publications and book on this topics. For a nice introduction (in the context of computer vision), I recommend 
Sebastian Nowozin, Christoph H. Lampert:
