class OneSlackSSVM(BaseSSVM):
    """Structured SVM solver for the 1-slack QP with l1 slack penalty.

    Implements margin rescaled structural SVM using
    the 1-slack formulation and cutting plane method, solved using CVXOPT.
    The optimization is restarted in each iteration.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : StructuredModel
        Object containing the model structure. Has to implement
        `loss`, `inference` and `loss_augmented_inference`.

    max_iter : int, default=10000
        Maximum number of passes over dataset to find constraints.

    C : float, default=1
        Regularization parameter.

    check_constraints : bool
        Whether to check if the new "most violated constraint" is
        more violated than previous constraints. Helpful for stopping
        and debugging, but costly.

    verbose : int
        Verbosity.

    negativity_constraint : list of ints
        Indices of parmeters that are constraint to be negative.
        This is useful for learning submodular CRFs (inference is formulated
        as maximization in SSVMs, flipping some signs).

    break_on_bad : bool default=False
        Whether to break (start debug mode) when inference was approximate.

    n_jobs : int, default=1
        Number of parallel jobs for inference. -1 means as many as cpus.

    show_loss_every : int, default=0
        Controlls how often the hamming loss is computed (for monitoring
        purposes). Zero means never, otherwise it will be computed very
        show_loss_every'th epoch.

    tol : float, default=1e-3
        Convergence tolerance. If dual objective decreases less than tol,
        learning is stopped. The default corresponds to ignoring the behavior
        of the dual objective and stop only if no more constraints can be
        found.

    inference_cache : int, default=0
        How many results of loss_augmented_inference to cache per sample.
        If > 0 the most violating of the cached examples will be used to
        construct a global constraint. Only if this constraint is not violated,
        inference will be run again. This parameter poses a memory /
        computation tradeoff. Storing more constraints might lead to RAM being
        exhausted. Using inference_cache > 0 is only advisable if computation
        time is dominated by inference.

    cache_tol : float, None or 'auto' default='auto'
        Tolerance when to reject a constraint from cache (and do inference).
        If None, ``tol`` will be used. Higher values might lead to faster
        learning. 'auto' uses a heuristic to determine the cache tolerance
        based on the duality gap, as described in [3].

    inactive_threshold : float, default=1e-5
        Threshold for dual variable of a constraint to be considered inactive.

    inactive_window : float, default=50
        Window for measuring inactivity. If a constraint is inactive for
        ``inactive_window`` iterations, it will be pruned from the QP.
        If set to 0, no constraints will be removed.

    switch_to : None or string, default=None
        Switch to the given inference method if the previous method does not
        find any more constraints.

    logger : logger object, default=None
        Pystruct logger for storing the model or extracting additional
        information.

    Attributes
    ----------
    w : nd-array, shape=(model.size_joint_feature,)
        The learned weights of the SVM.

    old_solution : dict
        The last solution found by the qp solver.

    ``loss_curve_`` : list of float
        List of loss values if show_loss_every > 0.

    ``objective_curve_`` : list of float
       Cutting plane objective after each pass through the dataset.

    ``primal_objective_curve_`` : list of float
        Primal objective after each pass through the dataset.

    ``timestamps_`` : list of int
       Total training time stored before each iteration.
