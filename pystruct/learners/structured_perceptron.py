class StructuredPerceptron(BaseSSVM):
    """Structured Perceptron training.

    Implements a simple structured perceptron with optional averaging.
    The structured perceptron approximately minimizes the zero-one loss,
    therefore the learning does not take ``model.loss`` into account. It is
    just shown to illustrate the learning progress.

    As the perceptron learning is not margin-based, the model does not
    need to provide loss_augmented_inference.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : StructuredModel
        Object containing model structure. Has to implement
        `loss`, `inference`.

    max_iter : int (default=100)
        Maximum number of passes over dataset to find constraints and update
        parameters.

    verbose : int (default=0)
        Verbosity

    batch : bool (default=False)
        Whether to do batch learning or online learning.

    decay_exponent : float, default=0
        Exponent for decaying learning rate. Effective learning rate is
        ``(t0 + t)** decay_exponent``. Zero means no decay.

    decay_t0 : float, default=10
        Offset for decaying learning rate. Effective learning rate is
        ``(t0 + t)** decay_exponent``. Zero means no decay.

    average : bool or int, default=False
        Whether to average over all weight vectors obtained during training
        or simply keeping the last one.
        ``average=False`` does not perform any averaging.
        ``average=True`` averages over all epochs.
        ``average=k`` with ``k >= 0`` waits ``k`` epochs before averaging.
        ``average=k`` with ``k < 0`` averages over the last ``k`` epochs.  So
        far ``k = -1`` is the only negative value supported.

    logger : logger object.

    Attributes
    ----------
    w : nd-array, shape=(model.size_joint_feature,)
        The learned weights of the SVM.

   ``loss_curve_`` : list of float
        List of loss values after each pass thorugh the dataset.
