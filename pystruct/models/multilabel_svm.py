class MultiLabelClf(CRF):
    """Multi-label model for predicting several binary classes.

    Multi-label classification is a generalization of multi-class
    classification, in that multiple classes can be present in each
    example. This can also be thought of as predicting
    binary indicator per class.

    This class supports different models via the "edges" parameter.
    Giving no eges yields independent classifiers for each class. Giving
    "full" yields a fully connected graph over the labels, while "tree"
    yields the best tree-shaped graph (using the Chow-Liu algorithm).
    It is also possible to specify a custom connectivity structure.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_labels : int (default=None)
        Number of labels. Inferred from data if not provided.

    n_features : int (default=None)
        Number of input features. Inferred from data if not provided.

    edges : array-like, string or None
        Either None, which yields independent models, 'tree',
        which yields the Chow-Liu tree over the labels, 'full',
        which yields a fully connected graph, or an array-like
        of edges for a custom dependency structure.

    inference_method :
        The inference method to be used.
