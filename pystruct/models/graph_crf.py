class GraphCRF(CRF):
    """Pairwise CRF on a general graph.

    Pairwise potentials the same for all edges, are symmetric by default
    (``directed=False``).  This leads to n_classes parameters for unary
    potentials.

    If ``directed=True``, there are ``n_classes * n_classes`` parameters
    for pairwise potentials, if ``directed=False``, there are only
    ``n_classes * (n_classes + 1) / 2`` (for a symmetric matrix).

    Examples, i.e. X, are given as an iterable of n_examples.
    An example, x, is represented as a tuple (features, edges) where
    features is a numpy array of shape (n_nodes, n_attributes), and
    edges is is an array of shape (n_edges, 2), representing the graph.

    Labels, Y, are given as an iterable of n_examples. Each label, y, in Y
    is given by a numpy array of shape (n_nodes,).

    There are n_states * n_features parameters for unary
    potentials. For edge potential parameters, there are n_state *
    n_states permutations, i.e. ::

                state_1 state_2 state 3
        state_1       1       2       3
        state_2       4       5       6
        state_3       7       8       9

    The fitted parameters of this model will be returned as an array
    with the first n_states * n_features elements representing the
    unary potentials parameters, followed by the edge potential
    parameters.

    Say we have two state, A and B, and two features 1 and 2. The unary
    potential parameters will be returned as [A1, A2, B1, B2].

    If ``directed=True`` the edge potential parameters will return
    n_states * n_states parameters. The rows are senders and the
    columns are recievers, i.e. the edge potential state_2 -> state_1
    is [2,1]; 4 in the above matrix.

    The above edge potential parameters example would be returned as
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] (see numpy.ravel).

    If edges are undirected, the edge potential parameter matrix is
    assumed to be symmetric and only the lower triangle is returned, i.e.
    [1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9].


    Parameters
    ----------
    n_states : int, default=None
        Number of states for all variables. Inferred from data if not provided.

    n_features : int, default=None
        Number of features per node. Inferred from data if not provided.

    inference_method : string or None, default=None
        Function to call do do inference and loss-augmented inference.
        Possible values are:

            - 'max-product' for max-product belief propagation.
                Recommended for chains an trees. Loopy belief propagatin in case of a general graph.
            - 'lp' for Linear Programming relaxation using cvxopt.
            - 'ad3' for AD3 dual decomposition.
            - 'qpbo' for QPBO + alpha expansion.
            - 'ogm' for OpenGM inference algorithms.

        If None, ad3 is used if installed, otherwise lp.

    class_weight : None, or array-like
        Class weights. If an array-like is passed, it must have length
        n_classes. None means equal class weights.

    directed : boolean, default=False
        Whether to model directed or undirected connections.
        In undirected models, interaction terms are symmetric,
        so an edge ``a -> b`` has the same energy as ``b -> a``.
