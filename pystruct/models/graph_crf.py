    Pairwise potentials are symmetric and the same for all edges.
    This leads to n_classes parameters for unary potentials and
    n_classes * (n_classes + 1) / 2 parameters for edge potentials.

    Node features are given as a tuple of shape (n_nodes, n_features),
    An instance ``x`` is represented as a tuple ``(features, edges)``
    where edges is an array of shape (n_edges, 2), representing the graph.

    Labels ``y`` are given as array of shape (n_features)

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_states : int, default=2
        Number of states for all variables.

    n_features : int, default=None
        Number of features per node. None means n_states.

    inference_method : string, default="qpbo"
        Function to call do do inference and loss-augmented inference.
        Possible values are:

            - 'qpbo' for QPBO + alpha expansion.
            - 'dai' for LibDAI bindings (which has another parameter).
            - 'lp' for Linear Programming relaxation using GLPK.
            - 'ad3' for AD3 dual decomposition.

    class_weight : None, or array-like
        Class weights. If an array-like is passed, it must have length
        n_classes. None means equal class weights.
