class GridCRF(GraphCRF):
    """Pairwise CRF on a 2d grid.

    Pairwise potentials are symmetric and the same for all edges.
    This leads to n_classes parameters for unary potentials and
    n_classes * (n_classes + 1) / 2 parameters for edge potentials.

    Unary evidence ``x`` is given as array of shape (width, height, n_states),
    labels ``y`` are given as array of shape (width, height). Grid sizes do not
    need to be constant over the dataset.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_states : int, or None, default=None
        Number of states for all variables.
        Inferred from the data if None.

    inference_method : string, default="ad3"

        Possible values are:

            - 'max-product' for max-product belief propagation.
                Recommended for chains an trees. Loopy belief propagatin in case of a general graph.
            - 'lp' for Linear Programming relaxation using cvxopt.
            - 'ad3' for AD3 dual decomposition.

    neighborhood : int, default=4
