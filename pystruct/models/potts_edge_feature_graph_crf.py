class PottsEdgeFeatureGraphCRF(EdgeFeatureGraphCRF):
    """Potts CRF with features/strength associated to each edge.

    Edge potentials are 0 if neighbors share the same state, some
    other value otherwise.

    Node features and edge features are given as a tuple of shape (n_nodes,
    n_features) and (n_edges, n_edge_features) respectively.

    An instance ``x`` is represented as a tuple ``(node_features, edges,
    edge_features)`` where edges is an array of shape (n_edges, 2),
    representing the graph.

    Labels ``y`` are given as array of shape (n_features)

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_states : int, default=2
        Number of states for all variables.

    n_features : int, default=None
        Number of features per node. None means n_states.

    n_edge_features : int, default=1
        Number of features per edge.

    inference_method : string, default="ad3"
        Function to call do do inference and loss-augmented inference.
        Possible values are:

            - 'qpbo' for QPBO + alpha expansion.
            - 'dai' for LibDAI bindings (which has another parameter).
            - 'lp' for Linear Programming relaxation using GLPK.
            - 'ad3' for AD3 dual decomposition.

    class_weight : None, or array-like
        Class weights. If an array-like is passed, it must have length
        n_classes. None means equal class weights.

            Only meaningful if inference method is 'lp' or 'ad3'.
